            <h2>Project 1: Basic Discord Bot</h2>
            <p>This is a basic bot that I made using DiscordJS, it has a few basic commands such as responding to "/Ping" with "Pong!", the ability to levy bans, and intergration with Twitch.tv's api to look up any streamer and relay to the user if the channel is live or not. </p>
            <p class="projectLink">The repository for the bot can be found <a href="https://github.com/jmt9816/Discord-Bot.git">here</a></p>

            <h2>Project 2: Basic Webscraper</h2>
            <p>This is was my dive into python, I used a mix of Beautiful Soup 4 and Selenuite to scrape a webpage for information and save it in a miniature database. I then parse out the relevant information so that when the user tries to look up a specific champion counter, the program responds with the top 3 results. This project also emplyed the use of GeckoEngine to launch an instance of firefox as the web page I was trying to scrape used a lot of JavaScript that needed to be loaded before it could be scraped.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: This Website!</h2>
            <p>That's right! This website was built from scratch using what I have learned from HTML and CSS. The plan was to have it both be the host for my portfolio as I grow as a developer as well as a fun project to motivate me to learn and practice the foundational building blocks of web development.</p>
